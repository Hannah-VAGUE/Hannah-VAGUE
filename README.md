# 🌟 Hey there, I'm Hannah! 😊

☁️ **Cloud Enthusiast | Tech Explorer | Solution Builder**  

I'm on a mission to go from **technical sales & product management** to full-fledged **cloud engineer**—and I'm having fun figuring it all out! 🚀  

## 🌍 My Journey So Far  
- Started in **networking & cloud solutions sales**, making tech **make sense** for businesses.  
- Dabbled in **UI/UX design**, because making things pretty AND functional is a superpower. 🎨  
- Fell in love with **cloud computing & automation**, and now I’m all about **deploying, securing, and scaling** cool things.  

## 🛠️ What I’m Playing With  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Learning my way around **Azure, and CI/CD** like a boss.  
- **Networking & Security**: Because a solid cloud setup needs a solid foundation.  
- **Automation**: Making life easier with **GitHub Actions, Terraform & scripting magic**.  

## 💡 Let’s Connect!
